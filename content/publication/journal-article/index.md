abstract: This paper predicts the ability to externally control the firing times of a cortical neuron whose behavior follows the Izhikevich neuron model. The Izhikevich neuron model provides an efficient and biologically plausible method to track a cortical neuronâ€™s membrane potential and its firing times. The external control is a simple optogenetic model represented by an illumination source that stimulates a saturating or decaying membrane current. This paper considers firing frequencies that are sufficiently low for the membrane potential to return to its resting potential after it fires. The time required for the neuron to charge and for the neuron to recover to the resting potential are numerically fitted to functions of the Izhikevich neuron model parameters and the peak input current. Results show that simple functions of the model parameters and maximum input current can be used to predict the charging and recovery times, even when there are deviations in the actual parameter values. Furthermore, the predictions lead to lower bounds on the firing frequency that can be achieved without significant distortion.

summary: This was a study conducted in my 3rd year of undergraduate studies where I investigated the effect of using light to control the rate of opening and closing of opsin proteins. The motivation here was to generate mathematical models that would control the firing time of a particular set of neurons using nothing but light stimulus.
